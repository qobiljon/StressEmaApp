# Privacy Policy

The sole purpose of the app is to provide means to self-report momentary feelings for participants of Stress Sensing study at Inha University, South Korea.

At the start of application, a user is automatically assigned numbers as their identification method, in order to keep anonymity.
The application does not collect any personal data from the research participants except information about position.
To keep full anonymity and privacy, the location data is hashed (i.e. SHA256) before any use. 
The location data is then only used to see the number of unique places in a given month.

The application will be removed from App Store and Play Store, and all the data (though anonymized) will be removed completely after December 31, 2021.
